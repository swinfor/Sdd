SDD-SQL Database Developer

The use of a graphical interface is the best way to access database information for an ad-hoc query.

All relational databases have a way to offer this type of access using fancy interfaces.

The SDD-SQL Database Developer is a web interface to provide a simple way for DMSII users to submit SQL ANSI queries to retrieve information.

SDD is free but it is not open-source.

The basic features present in the SDD are:

• Web interface to submit SQL statements to DMSII databases with the result displayed in a grid

• Use an Oracle database to store parameters and activity

• Results can be stored in CSV files

• Log of all queries submitted by the users

• Function to store queries to be used anytime

• Profiles to restrict access to databases. Users can only access databases assigned to them.

• Inquiry and Inquiry/Update access

• Use Unisys-MCPSQL or Unisys-JDBC

• Resource control: timeout for online queries, the maximum number of records returned, only one online query in execution per user, queries in background mode to be executed asynchronously

• Background query module to control the asynchronous queries

• Menu for support users to check the executions

• Control the external access to DMSII databases from only one location: the application server
